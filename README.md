# FEND Project #3: Weather Journal
## Overview

**Weather Journal** is the third project of Udacity [Front End Web Developer](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011) nanodegree program. It requires to build a single-page JavaScript app which creates a weather record for user based on their input and data from [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

The goal of the project is to practice with:
* setting up ***Node*** environment with ***Express*** and project dependencies
* setting up a server with ```GET``` and ```POST``` routes
* using ```fetch API``` with [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) credentials 
* accessing a ```GET``` route on the server side from a function called on the client side
* promise chaining
* dynamically updating properties of *HTML* elements

## Features
* Local server (*server.js*) is running on ```port 3030```.
* Data is retrieved from external [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/current#zip) in ```JSON``` format.
  * API calls use ```zip code``` entered by the user. Search works only for US zips.
* The following values are updated dynamically:
  * date
  * temperature
  * user input
